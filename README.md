👋🏻 Hi, I'm Sandeep. I've been building things on the web for [over 22 years](https://sandeepchopra.ca/note/offline-blog-editor). First as a hobby, then as a career pivot that finally felt right.

I live in [London, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London,_Ontario) with my wife and our 8-year-old daughter.

## What I Do

I build enterprise UI platforms: micro-frontends, design systems, and complex workflow UIs. My toolkit spans Angular, React, and TypeScript, but what I really care about is reliability, testing, and helping teams ship consistently.

I've led frontend delivery across CRM platforms, logistics planning tools, and multi-tenant systems. I enjoy translating ambiguous requirements into clean, maintainable interfaces, and mentoring others to do the same. I take immense pride in [my craft](https://sandeepchopra.ca/software-craftsmanship).

## Beyond the Code

- **Founder** of [Coders Collective London](https://coderscollective.ca), a local dev community for learning and building together
- **Revived the London chapter** of [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/): 30+ volunteers, 200+ students, 10+ workshops
- [**3 platinum trophies**](https://trophies.sandeepchopra.ca/) and counting (PS5)
- I love making and sharing memes, the teams I work with fondly remembers me as Chief Meme Officer
